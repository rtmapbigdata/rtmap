Flume classes
=============

This project contains utility classes for Flume. You will find :

* The `HeaderAndBodyTextEventSerializer` serializer present in
version 1.3 so we could use it in the Cloudera Distribution 4.1.3
(latest version at the time of this writing) which ship Flume 1.2.
* A new `JSONEventSerializer` which write header and body event as JSON lines.

HeaderAndBodyTextEventSerializer
--------------------------------

This class simply writes the header properties and body of the event
to the output stream and appends a newline after each event. The
"columns" configuration allows to list and order the columns to
write. The `format` configuration accept `NATIVE` and `CSV`. In the
case of the `CSV` serialization, the fields default to being
comma-delimited. This can be changed using the `delimiter` directive.
The example below sets the output to be tab-separated. Note that
only single character delmiters are possible. Strings are quoted and
escaped by default.
 
Example
```coffee
a1.sources.r1.type = syslogtcp
a1.sources.r1.host = 0.0.0.0
a1.sources.r1.port = 5141

a1.sources.r1.interceptors = i1 i2
a1.sources.r1.interceptors.i1.type = timestamp
a1.sources.r1.interceptors.i2.type = host
a1.sources.r1.interceptors.i2.hostHeader = hostname

a1.sinks.s1.type = hdfs
a1.sinks.s1.hdfs.path = hdfs://namenode:8020/user/hdfs/logs.json
a1.sinks.s1.serializer = com.adaltas.flume.serialization.HeaderAndBodyTextEventSerializer$Builder
a1.sinks.s1.serializer.columns = timestamp hostname Facility Severity
a1.sinks.s1.serializer.format = CSV
a1.sinks.s1.serializer.appendNewline = true
a1.sinks.s1.serializer.delimiter = \t
```

JSONEventSerializer
-------------------

This class writes the header properties and body of the event as
JSON lines. The body is by default associated with the `body` key.
The `columns` configuration allows to list and order the columns
to write. It must contains the name of the body key if you wish to
write the event body. The `body` configuration is the name of the
key associated to the event body.

Example
```coffee
a1.sinks.s1.type = hdfs
a1.sinks.s1.hdfs.path = hdfs://namenode:8020/user/hdfs/logs.json
a1.sinks.s1.serializer = com.adaltas.flume.serialization.JSONEventSerializer$Builder
a1.sinks.s1.serializer.columns = timestamp msg
a1.sinks.s1.serializer.body = msg
a1.sinks.s1.serializer.appendNewline = true
```

Notes
-----

The JSON serializer as been submitted as [FLUME-1909](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/FLUME-1909) to the Flume Jira.

Development
-----------

Maven 3 must be installed on your system. To test and compile the project, run `mvn clean test jar:jar`.
